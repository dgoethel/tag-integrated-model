# tag-integrated-model
Simulation-estimation model for spatially-explicit tag-integrated model used for Fisheries Research tagging design manuscript. This is part of the Spatial Processes and Stock Assessment Methods (SPASAM) framework (see https://github.com/KateBoz/SPASAM and https://github.com/dgoethel/Spatial-Assessment-Simulator).

These are the model files used as the basis for the fisheries research paper "Exploring the utility of 
alternate mark-recapture experimental designs for use in spatially explicit, tag-integrated stock assessment models"
